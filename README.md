# project-Django-PostgresSQL-React-OrtalYatzkan
Summary of work on the project-Ortal Yatzkan<br>
 When I started the exercise I had a basic knowledge of react and python.<br>
During the exercise I first programmed in django and the first time I used the postgresql database.<br>
I will detail how I did the exercise and what materials I used:<br>
<b>First step:</b><br>
I searched youtube for videos about django and postgresql.<br>
I watched the video:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwwz4_AvHDU<br>
You have to follow step by step to create the project and download the relevant software.<br>
<b>Second step:</b><br>
I used the following article to create a database and to understand how it works:<br>
https://stackpython.medium.com/how-to-start-django-project-with-a-database-postgresql-aaa1d74659d8.<br>
<b>Third step:</b><br>
Now that I have created the project and connected to the database and understood how to use the database, I started working on the client side, for this I used the previous knowledge I have in react, java script , HTML and css.
In case there is no prior knowledge on these topics you can start by reading the site:<br>
https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html<br>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics<br>
https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html<br>
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html<br>
<b>Fourth stage:</b><br>
Now that I have finished building the page structure of the client side by using react, html and java script I started trying to send requests from client side to server, for this purpose I first ran the client side and the network side by using the following commands:
Client side: npm start<br>
Server side: python manage.py runserver<br>
To understand how to write client-side requests to the server and reverse I used the sites:<br>
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-useeffect-absolute-beginners/<br>
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/<br>
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref <br>
<b>Fifth step:</b><br>
Now that I have been able to transfer data from client to server and server to client, I have started learning how to store data on the server.<br>
Examples that can help (Django code):<br>

<b>Step Six:</b><br>
In order to search the database I used the following explanations:<br>
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/search/<br>
<b>Step Seven:</b><br>
To export the data to an excel file I used the article:<br>

Installations:<br>
Visual studio code - source-code editor:<br>

Download PostgreSQL<br>

Visual studio installations:<br>
The directory for client API requests-<br>
npm i axios in<br>
npm install react-router-dom â€“save<br>
<b>There are other installations that appear in the videos and articles I mentioned.<br>
While working on the project, I used other videos on YouTube and sites like Stackoverflow to find solutions to problems I encountered.</b><br>
